# The Untyped Lambda Calculus, For The Uninitiated

Although most of the systems in this repository are focused on type systems,
this system aims to teach how the untyped lambda calculus works, in order to
demonstrate how one is defined, and to teach the following type-agnostic
procedures and concepts:

- Lambdas (duh)
- Alpha conversion ("renaming")
- Beta reduction ("evaluation")
- Free and bound variables
- Eta reduction
- Church encoding

At the moment there is no work done on it yet-- I just wanted to go ahead and
set up a place for it, with a list of goals set above.
