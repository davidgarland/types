# Types

Some experiments in type systems, with the intent of acting as a reference
implementation or learning aid for those who want a comprehensible, complete
source with some "literate code"-style write-ups. Most (or all) of the work
found here is based on work by others, either from reference implementations
or directly from a research paper, or some combination of the two.
